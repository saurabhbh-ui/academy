You will also understand the economic incentives and technical constraints that underpin these limitations.\n\n**Overview**: The rapid rise of crypto and DeFi has sparked debate about their potential to serve as the backbone of the monetary system. However, recent events and deeper analysis reveal significant shortcomings in their ability to deliver stability, efficiency, and integrity. This tutorial is based on The Future Monetary System: Central Bank Innovation, Crypto Limitations, and the Path Forward.\n\n**Content**:\n\n1. **Introduction Video Transcript**\n    - Introduce the context: the explosion of innovation in digital money and payments, and the emergence of crypto and DeFi as alternatives to traditional monetary systems.\n    - Highlight recent failures (e.g., TerraUSD collapse) and the need for a critical assessment of crypto’s suitability as a monetary foundation.\n    - Set the stage for understanding why central bank innovation is essential for a resilient and trustworthy monetary system.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: Introduction; Key takeaways)\n\n2. **Overall Tutorial Suite Details**\n    - Outline the scenario: a financial institution evaluating whether to integrate crypto-based solutions or to rely on central bank innovations.\n    - Identify stakeholders: central banks, regulators, private sector PSPs, and end users.\n    - Connect scenario to learning objectives: understanding the risks and limitations of crypto as a monetary system.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: Introduction; What do we want from a monetary system?)\n\n3. **High-Level Goals of the Monetary System**\n    - Present the core functions and policy goals for any monetary system: safety, stability, accountability, efficiency, inclusion, user control over data, integrity, adaptability, and openness.\n    - Compare how today’s system, the crypto universe, and the future vision fulfil these goals.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: What do we want from a monetary system?; Table 1)\n\n4. **The Promise and Pitfalls of Crypto**\n    - Examine the initial promise of crypto and DeFi, including programmability and decentralisation.\n    - Discuss the reality: price volatility, reliance on stablecoins, and the speculative nature of the ecosystem.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: The promise and pitfalls of crypto; The building blocks of crypto)\n\n5. **Stablecoins and the Search for a Nominal Anchor**\n    - Analyse the role of stablecoins in DeFi, their mechanisms (asset-backed vs algorithmic), and their inherent fragilities.\n    - Use the TerraUSD/Luna collapse as a case study to illustrate systemic risks.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: Stablecoins in search of a nominal anchor; Box A)\n\n6. **Structural Limitations: Scalability, Fragmentation, and Security**\n    - Explain the scalability trilemma: the trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability.\n    - Illustrate how fragmentation and high fees arise, and why network effects do not materialise as in traditional systems.\n    - Discuss the risks of cross-chain bridges and the prevalence of hacks.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: Structural limitations of crypto; Figures: Buterin’s “scalability trilemma”; Fragmentation of layer 1 blockchains; Bridges and hacks)\n\n7. **The DeFi Decentralisation Illusion and the Role of Exchanges**\n    - Assess the reality of centralisation in DeFi governance, oracles, and exchanges.\n    - Compare centralised (CEX) and decentralised (DEX) exchanges in terms of costs, volumes, and risks.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: The DeFi decentralisation illusion and the role of exchanges; Figures: Graph 5)\n\n8. **Regulatory Approaches and Systemic Risks**\n    - Outline regulatory challenges: arbitrage, KYC/AML, consumer protection, and financial stability.\n    - Highlight the need for international cooperation and the role of centralised intermediaries as regulatory gateways.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: Regulatory approaches to crypto risks; Institutional investors; Investments of large banks)\n\n9. **Lessons for the Monetary System**\n    - Summarise why crypto and DeFi cannot fulfil the high-level goals of a robust monetary system.\n    - Emphasise the importance of grounding innovation in sound institutional frameworks.\n    - Reference: (Document: Future Monetary System, Sections: Crypto’s lessons for the monetary system)\n\n---\n\n## Brief 2: The Future Monetary System – Central Bank Innovation and the Path Forward for the Monetary System\n\n**Objectives**: On completion of this tutorial, you will be able to evaluate the vision for a future monetary system grounded in central bank public goods, including the roles of CBDCs, fast payment systems, and advanced data architectures. You will be able to identify the key components, technological capabilities, and policy goals for a resilient, inclusive, and adaptable monetary system.\n\n**Overview**: As digital innovation reshapes the financial landscape, central banks are leading the way in designing a future monetary system that is stable, inclusive, and adaptable. This system leverages new technologies while maintaining trust and integrity through central bank money.
