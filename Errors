# Central Bank Digital Currencies: Foundational Principles and Core Features

## Brief 1: Central Bank Digital Currencies: Foundational Principles and Core Features - Motivations, Challenges, and Risks of CBDC

**Objectives**: On completion of this tutorial, you will be able to identify and evaluate the key motivations driving central bank digital currency (CBDC) research, understand the associated challenges and risks, and assess the implications for payment systems, monetary policy, and financial stability.

**Overview**: The rapid digitalisation of payment systems and declining use of cash have prompted central banks to explore the potential of CBDCs. This tutorial examines the motivations, challenges, and risks associated with CBDC research, focusing on payment system resilience, financial inclusion, and monetary policy impacts. The content is based on Central Bank Digital Currencies: Foundational Principles and Core Features.

**Content**:

1. **Introduction Video Transcript**
    - Introduce the tutorial suite, highlighting the global shift towards digital payments and the growing interest in CBDCs among central banks.
    - Present a scenario where a central bank is evaluating the need for a CBDC to address declining cash usage and increasing digitalisation.
    - Emphasise the importance of understanding motivations, risks, and challenges before any decision to issue a CBDC.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Sections: Executive summary; 1. Introduction)

2. **Overall Tutorial Suite Details**
    - Outline the scenario: a central bank facing declining cash usage, increased digital payments, and the need to ensure monetary and financial stability.
    - Identify stakeholders: central banks, payment service providers, the public, and government agencies.

    - Discuss the implications of interest-bearing CBDC and programmable monetary policy.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Section: 2.2 Monetary policy motivations and risks)

6. **Financial Stability Risks**
    - Assess risks such as bank disintermediation, destabilising digital runs, and loss of monetary sovereignty.
    - Explore mitigants and the need for robust safeguards in CBDC design.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Section: 2.3 Financial stability risks)

7. **Balancing Motivations and Risks**
    - Summarise the need for central banks to balance opportunities and risks when considering CBDC issuance.
    - Highlight the importance of jurisdiction-specific analysis and common principles.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Section: 2.4 Balancing motivations and risks)

## Brief 2: Central Bank Digital Currencies: Foundational Principles and Core Features - Foundational Principles and Core Features of CBDC

**Objectives**: On completion of this tutorial, you will be able to describe the foundational principles guiding CBDC issuance and explain the core features required for a CBDC to fulfil central bank public policy objectives.

**Overview**: Central banks share common public policy objectives that inform the foundational principles for CBDC issuance. This tutorial details these principles and the core features necessary for a CBDC to support monetary and financial stability, coexistence with other forms of money, and innovation. The content is based on Central Bank Digital Currencies: Foundational Principles and Core Features.

**Content**:

1. **Recap of Scenario and Tutorial Suite**
    - Briefly revisit the scenario: a central bank evaluating CBDC to address evolving payment needs and maintain stability.
    - Reiterate the relevance of foundational principles and core features in guiding CBDC design.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Sections: Executive summary; 1. Introduction)

2. **Common Public Policy Objectives**
    - Outline the shared objectives of central banks: monetary stability, financial stability, and broad access to safe payments.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Section: 3 Issuing a CBDC)

3. **Three Foundational Principles for CBDC**
    - Detail the principles: "Do no harm" to central bank mandates, coexistence with cash and private money, and promotion of innovation and efficiency.
    - Explain the rationale and implications of each principle.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Section: 3.1 Three foundational principles)

4. **Core Features of a CBDC Instrument**
    - Present the instrument features: convertibility, convenience, acceptance, availability, and low cost.
    - Discuss how these features support adoption and accessibility.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Section: 3.2 Core features; Table 1)

5. **Core Features of the CBDC System**
    - Summarise system features: security, instant settlement, resilience, availability, throughput, scalability, interoperability, flexibility, and adaptability.
    - Highlight the importance of these features for operational effectiveness and user experience.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Section: 3.2 Core features; Table 1)

6. **Institutional Features and Standards**
    - Describe the need for a robust legal framework and regulatory standards for CBDC issuance and operation.
    - Reference: (Document: CBDC, Section: 3.2 Core features; Table 1)
